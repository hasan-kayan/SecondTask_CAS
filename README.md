# Udemy Coupon Scraper

This is a Python script that scrapes Udemy coupons from three different websites: real.discount, discudemy.com, and couponscorpion.com. It uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries to navigate the webpages, extract data and write to a CSV file.

### NOTE : The code was previously prepared on the linux operating system, but it was organized according to windows. If you are going to run it on a Linux or Mac device, you need to make path arrangements.
