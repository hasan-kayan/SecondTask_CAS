# Udemy Coupon Scraper

This is a Python script that scrapes Udemy coupons from three different websites: real.discount, discudemy.com, and couponscorpion.com. It uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries to navigate the webpages, extract data and write to a CSV file.

Before we start lets make a preparation. 

### NOTE : The code was previously prepared on the Linux operating system, but it was organized according to Windows. If you are going to run it on a Linux or Mac device, you need to make path arrangements.

## Prerequests 

- Python 3.11.2 or later version should be installed on your system.
- Chrome driver only supports for 111 version, so be check your Chrome browser version. 
- Before you run the code you need to install all libraries, to do that I created a 'requirements.txt' file you cann call it at the terminal to install all needed libraries. How call 'requirements.txt' :
    . Open your terminal
    .Run this command : pip install -r requirements.txt
